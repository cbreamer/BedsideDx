	    Foot and Ankle Exam
	    
    

  
  
    Introduction 

  
  
 














    The physical exam is of crucial importance for the clinical evaluation of painful conditions of the foot and ankle. These disorders are very common in the outpatient setting, both among professional athletes and recreational exercisers. It is important to be familiar with some basic maneuvers and physical signs necessary to assess the presence and the severity of lesions in the osteo-ligamentous structures of the foot.

    Important anatomical structures that one must be familiar with while examining the painful ankle and foot, are the following:

	Lateral ligaments of the ankle:	Anterior Talo-Fibular Ligament (ATFL): running anteriorly from the lateral malleolus to the talusPosterior Talo
	Fibular Ligament (PTFL): running posteriorly from the lateral malleolus to the posterior aspect of the talus
	Calcaneo-Fibular ligament (CFL): running from the lateral malleolus to the lateral aspect of the calcaneous, in the middle between the ATFL and the PTFL



	Achilles tendon
	The talar dome: upper portion of the talus, where the articular cartilage for the tibiotalar joint is located
	Metatarsal bones
	Interdigital nerves

	    Lateral Ankle Sprain
	    
    

  
  
    Foot and Ankle Exam

  
  
 














    One of the most common causes of foot pain is a lateral ankle sprain. In the mildest presentations, the only structures to be injured are the lateral ankle ligaments, usually in the number or one or two. However, if the damage is more severe, we can observe lesions of all the lateral ligaments plus other structures like the talar dome, the base of 5th metatarsal and the tibio-fibular syndesmosis.

The approach is to check for the integrity of the lateral ligaments first and if all the three ligaments are injured, then we will check the other structures.

Then, observe the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle for hematomas or bruises. 

Then, locate the three lateral ligaments and palpate along their course for crepitus and tenderness.

    This is a provocative test done to check for the integrity of the ATFL. One hand holds the leg down, while the other hand pulls the foot upwards and anteriorly. It is important to compare one side with the other. The presence of tenderness or laxity on one side only indicates an ATFL rupture.

    This is a provocative test done to check for the integrity of the CFL. Forcefully invert the foot while keeping the leg still with the other hand. Make sure to compare side to side. Again, tenderness or laxity on one side indicate a CFL lesion.

    To assess for an osteochondral defect we must first locate the talar dome and then palpate to elicit tenderness. 

To locate the talar dome we must identify the lateral malleolus and then move anteriorly from it, up to the anterior recess. From here we can move medially and anteriorly along the joint line. The talar dome will be right beneath this point.

Any tenderness elicited by palpating at the level of the anterior joint line is indicative of an osteochondral defect.

If there is a high grade
ankle sprain with associated damage of the talar dome and/or a 5th
metatarsal fracture, we must rule out an injury of the syndesmosis. To assess
for a syndesmosis damage, we can use two provocative tests: the external
rotation test and the squeeze test.

    Achilles tendinopathy is one of the most common foot pathologies. It can affect both athletes and recreational exercisers, being reported in inactive people as well. Clinically it manifests with foot pain on exertion associated with swellings, nodules and tenderness on palpation of the tendon.

    To assess for Achilles tendinopathy, palpate the entire length of the tendon moving downwards. Identify any fusiform swellings, defects or tenderness.

    Also, palpate the sides of the tendon at the level of the heel to check for the presence of a bursa, or for any bony spurs.

 

Once an abnormality is identified, if it moves upon flexion and extension of the foot, then we can conclude that it is part of the Achilles tendon.

    Squeeze Test or Thompson’s Test

To confirm a suspected Achilles tendon rupture, have the patient lying prone and then squeeze the calf while observing the foot. If there is plantar flexion of the foot, this means that the tendon is intact. Otherwise, a reduced or absent plantar flexion, when compared with the other side, is indicative of a tendon rupture.

    Also, observe how the foot falls off the bed. A normal foot would be slightly raised and plantar flexed. A foot that is dropping in dorsiflexion would be a sign of Achilles tendon rupture.

    Mulder's Click

It is a provocative test that consists in compressing the metatarsal heads. If the pain is reproduced and/or a click is felt upon palpation, then the test is considered positive for the presence of a Morton’s neuroma.

The most common site for a stress fracture in the
forefoot is the 2nd metatarsal, given that most of the body’s weight
is transferred on this particular bone during every given gait cycle.









To uncover a stress
fracture on physical exam, carefully palpate the 2nd metatarsal in
all its length. Tenderness upon palpation would be a sign that a fracture is
present.

    This represents the most common cause of heel pain.

The pain is usually described as sharp and tends to be more intense with the first steps after long periods without weigh bearing, such as after a night sleep.

There are two ways of confirming the suspicion of plantar fasciitis on physical exam.

    A common cause of both pain and deformity of the forefoot is the hallux valgus or bunion. It consists of a valgus deformity of the first MTP joint. The etiology is not completely understood even though it seems to be related to wearing tight shoes. Also, it is more commonly diagnosed in women.

    Physical exam findings

It is usually possible to elicit a characteristic crepitus of the first MTP joint upon palpation.

Also, there is usually evidence of restricted ROM of the first MTP joint.
