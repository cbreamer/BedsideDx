    All nevi (or moles) should be taken seriously as they may be normal or represent a cancer. Here we review the characteristics of any mole that should increase suspicion of cancer.

    Hi, my name is Jennifer Chen and I'm a clinical assistant professor here at Stanford Medicine.

Today we're going to talk about how to approach a patient with multiple nevi or moles and we have a patient here for you today who we’ll examine together.

Hi, I'm Jennifer Chen, nice to meet you. Okay, are you ready for us to take a look at you today?

I'm ready.

Great.

So when I look at a patient who we’re doing a full-body skin exam on I always start by trying to get a general feel for how many moles there are and how they're distributed so normally what I would do is go in a systematic manner from the head down to the toes so I start with the scalp then I move on to the face making sure to look at the medial canthi you want to look at the ears including the conchal bowls, then I move down to the arms making sure to remove any jewelry that might be obscuring my view of what's going on on the skin.

Make sure also that when you look at the hands and feet you're also looking at the web spaces between the fingers and toes. So now we're going to take a look at a few different findings here.  So we can start right up here on the forehead. When you examine the skin you always want to get your fingers involved. You want to be able to tell is it a papule? Something you can feel?  Or is it a macule, something that you can't feel when you run your fingers over it? Right here you can see that there's a gritty papule that can't really be seen so easily with the naked eye but you can feel it when you run your finger over it.  That is an actinic keratosis a precancerous growth that we do like to treat to prevent skin cancer and that's the classic presentation where we'll see it or we'll feel it before we can see it.

You can move on to the back here. So taking a look here you can see multiple non blanchable bright red vascular papules.  This is called a cherry angioma.  They're extremely common and they run in families. So here you see pink and brown symmetric bin papule with some central hairs.  It's symmetric, it's one color, it's smaller than six millimeters.  This is a normal mole.

Let's move on to your arms. So over here you have stuck on appearing brown thin flat-topped plaque.  This is a separate keratosis that looks like it could be a sticker just stuck right on the skin. That characteristic stuck on appearance can help you to distinguish a separate keratosis from a mole. These are common in everyone as they age and they are nothing to worry about.

The ABCDES is a mnemonic to help you remember what features you're looking for that could indicate melanoma.  A stands for asymmetry. B stands for border irregularity like notched or scalloped borders.  C stands for multiple colors.  There may be shades of tan brown or black or sometimes red white or blue. D stands for diameter. Melanomas are usually greater than six millimeters, about the size of a pencil eraser, but they can be smaller. E stands for evolution or change and this is the most important sign. If something is changing you want to take it seriously.



The ugly duckling sign refers to looking for a mole that looks different from all the rest. This can usually be a very helpful hint towards fighting a melanoma. In summary it's especially important when you're looking for melanoma to always do a thorough skin exam.

Remember: be systematic, don't miss those hidden areas like the conchal bowls the medial canthi, the inner gluteal cleft and perianal region and the finger and toe web spaces.  Make sure you take a thorough history and physical and take seriously anything that the patient thinks is new or changing. Thank you for your time.  Please refer to the Stanford 25 website for more information.

Before you can make a diagnosis of any skin lesion, it's important to be able to accurately describe the skin lesion. The purpose of this page is to cover the fundamental knowledge you will need to do this.

If screening for melanoma:

	Be systematic (from head to toes)
	If you're really doing a full body exam, don't miss these areas:	Conchal bowls (inside the ears)
	Medial cathi (see figure)

    Seborrheic keratosis

These are common, benign skin lesions that occur more frequently with age. The are often described as "stuck-on" lesions, as if a ball small ball of gum was thrown again a wall and stuck to it. There is nothing needed to do for these lesions other than reassure your patient. (Note: patients with many of these, such as greater than 50, often all over torso can be a sign of a hidden malignancy, usually with the gastrointestinal tract. This is referred to as the sign of Leser-Trelat.)











                    
                
            

        
            
                
                
                
                    
                
                
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
























    




    
    
        
    




    

    
    
        





    
    
    
    
    
        
        
            
            
            
                
                    
                
                
            

            
            
                
                    
                    
                
                
            

            
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
            


            

            
                
                
                    
























                
            

            
        

        

    






                    
                
            

        

    

    

  
















    
    
    
        
    
    
    


    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
        
    



    
    
        
    




    
    
        
    













  
  

    
        

        
            
                
                
                    
                
                
                
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        












    Cherry hemangioma

A normal and very common lesion, these are caused by the proliferation of small blood vessels in the skin.

Usually greater than 6mm, which is about the size of a pencil eraser. However, remember small moles do not rule out melanoma. 











                    
                
            

        
            
                
                
                
                    
                
                
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
























    




    
    
        
    




    

    
    
        





    
    
    
    
    
        
        
            
            
            
                
                    
                
                
            

            
            
                
                    
                    
                
                
            

            
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
            


            

            
                
                
                    



























                
            

            
        

        

    






                    
                
            

        

    

    

  

















    


















    
    
    
        
    
    
    


    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
        
    



    
    
        
    




    
    
        
    













  
  

    
        

        
            
                
                
                    
                
                
                
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        












    Evolving

This is the most important sign! If a lesion is changing (e.g. growing, new colors or change in border), you should keep a high suspicion for melanoma.

Clinical Pearl

When you examin the skin, always get your fingers involved to palpate lesions that are harder to see. A classic example of this is the skin cancer precursor called an actinic keratosis (image below). In this lesion, you often feel it before it becomes easier to see.
